# MapTest
Android test project

1. Take the sample data given in MainActivity, And display them in a map as markers.

2. Also list all the data in a list as overlay on the map (HINT: USE SLIDE UP PANEL:) )

3. And when the marker is tapped , give some visual indication on the list item that is associated with the Marker (Basically you need to map/couple markers
   and List items well so that that are interlinked.)

4. Best practices will be rewarded :)
